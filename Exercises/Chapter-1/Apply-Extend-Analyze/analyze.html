      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>

      <p>You use text editing software to create HTML pages.</p>

      <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.</p>

      <p>HTML is rendered by the user agent.</p>

      <p>This page would likely render without corrections, though maybe not as expected. Modern
         browsers are very fault-tolerant.

      <p>Okay, I take that back. The closing tag for <code>title</code> had the slash in the wrong spot
         ( <code>&lt;title/&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code> ), so it never closed
         and nothing rendered, because it was all stuck in the title.
