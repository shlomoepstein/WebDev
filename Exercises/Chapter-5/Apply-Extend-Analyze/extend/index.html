            <h2>Sticky</h2>

            <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
            <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
            <p>Positioned in flow, then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box relative">
            <h2>Relative</h2>

            <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
            <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
            <p>Positioned in flow, then offset relative to that position.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box fixed">
            <h2>Fixed</h2>

            <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
            <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
            <p>Removed from flow, positioned relative to its initial containing block.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box absolute">
            <h2>Absolute</h2>

            <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
            <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
            <p>Removed from flow, positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor.</p>
