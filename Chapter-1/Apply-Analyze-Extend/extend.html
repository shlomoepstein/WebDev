      <p>Principle 1: Perceivable</p>

      <p>Guideline 1.1: There should be a text alternative for all non-text content, like images,
         controls that are not text, CAPTCHAs, and other things that are not text.
      </p>

      <p>Guideline 1.2: There should be an alternative for time-based media, e.g. text transcripts
         for audio, or an audio track that describes what&#x2019;s happening in a video.
      </p>

      <p>Guideline 1.3: There should be a text or programmatic alternative for structural information
         that is in a visual form. For example using semantic elements for structure instead of
         relying on the visual structure.
      </p>

      <p>Guideline 1.4: Visuals should be accessible with enough contrast, audio should be mutable,
         text should be easily resizable, stuff like that. Avoid text in images (i.e. text content
         in image form).
