      <p>I am using
         <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a>
         to edit text. Zed is a high performance code editor from the creators of Atom and

         It is written in Rust.

      <p>How to plan a website:
         <br>
         Begin by planning your website. Continue planning until you are finished planning your website.
         Congratulations! You just planned a website. Also make
         <a href="https://www.figma.com/">wireframes</a>.

      <p>I learned several interesting things in this chapter. For instance, there is an online code
         editor called
         &#x201C;<a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/?open=lib%2Fscript.js">Plunker</a>&#x201D;.
         There was also a picture of a tomato that made me hungry.

      <p>Sidebar: The <code>lang</code> attribute</p>
      <p> You can set the language with the global <code>lang</code> attribute. This is generally set for
         the whole page by putting it in the opening <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, but you can set it
         for any tag.
      </p>
      <p>Some examples are <code>en-US</code> for US English, <code>he</code> for Hebrew, and
         <code>lb</code> for Luxembourgish. Sadly there is no code for
         <a href="https://graphemica.com/%E2%B0%A2">Glagolitic</a>.
      </p>
      <p><code>lang</code> is not required, but is recommended. When set, screen readers work properly,
         and the sun shines a little more brightly. It will also make the right decimal separator show
         on a virtual keyboard when <code>contenteditable="true"</code> and
         <code>inputmode="decimal"</code>. Some countries use a dot, some like their commas.
